This series heart-warming as fuck. Easily the best thing I've watched all year
(OK maybe _Into the Spiderverse_ ties, but far and way the best anime of the
year). I want to be friends with Naru, who is easily the best character (in a
cast of fantastic characters, all of whom I would love to be friends with!)

I... this show never really gets dark, which feels so rare these days. It's
incredibly invested in being honest though. It's a very real-feeling depiction
of what it can be like to be a creative artist, especially when struggling with
impostor syndrome and self-doubt and block and feeling like a plagiarist and
wondering what your own style or art looks like.

Sure, it's a story about a spoiled rich kid whose parents ship him off to the
country side so he can learn humanity and authenticity from the locals, so
that's shitty... but it's also a story about someone whose just... lost in the
city finding real human connections and being willing to discard his prejudices
and join the community he's moved to. Handa is definitely a spoiled brat, but he
sure as shit stops being that when he sees what community can be.

I love the moments when the show takes the piss of out itself too. Early on,
Tamako, one of the village teens, becomes obsessed with the misconception that
Handa and Hiroshi might be... _gasp, yaoi_ and it goes full on heightened
realism in a way that is gently mocking her reaction (which isn't homophobic,
more questioning her own attraction to the theme in manga and now irl), whilst
never making her appear less. Or the two characters she (incorrectly) suspects
are gay and into each other.

It's still a gay joke, and there's definitely a lot in anime that can do better
with that, but this feels more like a joke about a girl misunderstanding a
social situation because she loves yaoi manga, rather than being a joke at the
expense of homosexual folk. I am however, saying this from a reasonably
comfortable position as someone who gets to pass for cis whenever they want, so
I'm not going to stamp this. Like I said, anime has a rough relationship with
queerness.

The episode where Handa ends up in a bug-catching contest with Kentaro trying to
find the best present for Naru's birthday is amazing. Handa keeps going for it,
and keeps getting grossed out. It's sweet that he is so invested in getting Naru
a present she'll love that he'll keep going after beetles. It's also hilarious
that he gets so competitive with Kentaro, a 6 year old, over who can catch the
best bug (Kentaro, no contest!).

Which, I think, is really the heart of the show. Sure, there're moments where
people dispense wisdom to Handa, but it's really about seeing what friendship
can be when people just... hang out. Handa, Naru, Hiroshi, Miwa... they all
become family. And it's just so damn heart-warming.

It's an anime that stays on my shelf. It's so damn good.
