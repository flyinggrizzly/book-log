summary: |
  Mobile Suit Gundam is a trojan horse anime (see what I did there?... that joke
  is mostly for Gundam fans, sorry). It looks like a standard _shounen_ show,
  where a young man demonstrates rapidly advancing skill piloting a giant and
  powerful humanoid war mech. In reality it is that, and sharp commentary on the
  damage our desire for war is doing to our fragile ecosystem, and the
  irreparable damage it does to the minds of our youth--those on whom our future
  rests, and whom we inevitably force into fighting our conflicts.

Look. This anime is fucking phenomenal. It's a desert-island pick for me. It's
also one of those few anime that, even if mecha isn't your jam (who even are you
though?), I would still recommend you watch (at least in an ideal world... but
let's be honest, no one has time for everything).

I'm going to focus on one or two really standout episodes and elements, but here
is a laundry-list of ways in which this anime wins everything:

- strong women
- a camera that is aware of the imbalance in relationships between men and
    women, especially in a workplace-like setting
- really, really fantastic mecha action
- important and poignant things it says through that mech action (*not* just
    war/robots are cool!)
- absolutely gorgeous animation (at least, a lot of the time). Seriously, you
    could make a supercut of the explosion animations and I would be mesmerized
    for days. And that [damn Itano](https://ghostlightning.wordpress.com/2010/12/27/moments-of-2010-genesis-of-gundam-chapter-19-the-genesis-of-ichiro-itano/)
    flamingo scene...
- some seriously excellent music, especially ["Gallant Char"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GsQSJzmd1A)
- speaking of Char, Gundam also has Char and [Ikeda Shuuichi](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0407454/)'s gorgeous voice
