These are the books I've read, the anime, movies, and TV I've watched, the games
I've played. Not all of them, but the more recent ones.

I wanted to do a better job of remembering them, and have a way to search
through them and stuff.

Also, publishing this on the internet I hope will encourage me to read more, and
be more actively critical of the media I consume and enjoy (or not).
