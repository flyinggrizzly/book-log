summary: |
  Humanity has survived the threats it brings against itself today, to prosper
  and colonize throughout the galaxy. The Brin project exists to accelerate and
  observe the evolution of apes on a world without human interference, in the
  hope that humans will one day have others to interact with in space. Then...
  the end of humanity comes, and its survivors search for survival, and the
  subjects of the Brin project grow and expand their own budding civilization.

First off, I really enjoyed this book. It lacks the urgency and life that I'm
finding myself more and more drawn to, but in many ways it narrates itself as a
fable or fairy tale—detached and observing. It sometimes comments on its own
action. Definitely takes a Brechtian position in relation to its business.

I do have to say that Holsten is just... meh. Lukewarm. Beige. Whitebread.
Entirely undeserving of being the focal point of half the novel. I get that he
serves to underscore and counterpoint a lot of the real meat of the action and
narrative, and I definitely asked myself the questions I think I should have, in
no small part because he's such a mealy wanker, so I guess the Brechtian stance
works... but also he's a just meh. Not even a a PoS (though there are moments
where he is), he's mostly just... meh. Basically, he's every weak-willed
wannagood privileged and therefore untested person you grew up with in a
middleclass neighborhood. The guy who had everything just... there, so never
grew a spine, or formed opinions or drives. Driftwood.

OK now that I've gotten that out of the way, we can talk about the rest of the
book. Spoilers from here on out.

I think my favorite thing is the reuse of names for the spiders. It's a lovely
way of creating continuities and then breaking our expectations with the
repeated characters not repeating.

I also really appreciated the care with which Tchaikovsky handles describing a
spider’s world and frames of reference. He doesn’t just say that the Messenger
and spiders don’t comprehend each other because of frames of reference, but
spends time building the unfamiliar frame, with material ties to their
morphology and habits and environment. 

There is maybe a conversation to have about whether Tchaikovsky is backing
biological determinism, especially in regards to sex and gender roles, but I
think he’s careful enough to pay close attention to the more extreme case of
sexual dimorphism in the spiders (which is very unlike humans’ mild dimorphism),
and also draws out the lie that sex must prescribe capability. He doesn’t really
get into gender... and I wonder if a later formation of a Fabian or Bianca story
where their gender wasn’t binary conforming might have strengthened the
argument. But anyways. 

It’s odd to examine this in a case where the males of the species are on the
down of the power dynamic, but not unwelcome. 

I think in short the gender and sex elements of the book are... fine. Not
brilliant, but not actively terrible. 

The moment when Kern finally stopped dictating the terms of her relationship to
the spiders, and said "I'm listening", was a moment of genuinely unexpected joy
and catharsis for me. She had been demonstrating huge hubris throughout the
novel, from her miscalculation of her crew at the beginning, to her refusal to
listen to the humans on the Ark... but Tchaikovsky had done enough work, enough
build of her noticing discrepancies between reality and her own
perceptions/demands of reality, that that moment really worked for me. It was
wonderful. I also like that she just... kinda disappears into spider society
after that. I appreciate the spiders' continuing investment in symbiosis with
their world.

Overall, really lovely read. I think there's more to talk about, especially the
parallels between Lain's 'tribe's' attitude toward their society and the
spiders', and their appreciation of the obligations coexistence brings (and the
ways in which their lives are very different—the tribe being born to service,
and the spiders having a much broader choice in their lives at the moments where
they exist at the same time). I think the tribe's attitude is a nice bridge to
the humans' entrance into symbiosis with the spiders. It would have felt like
deus ex machina that the spiders managed to evoke that much empathy if all we
had seen were the Key Crew and mutineers' utilitarianism and selfishness (not
necessarily a judgement either way).
