summary: |
  Something like the clash of _Hamlet_, _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_,
  (which yea, same story but also very different stories), and Greek myth,
  narrated in the second person present-tense of an MUD. The story of the rises
  and falls of... dynasties, gods, and the story of a faithful servant. I guess.
  This one is hard to describe.

So, even more so than in the _Ancillary_ series, Leckie does a really great job
of slowly parcelling out information, keeping action driving forward while
obfuscating the truth of the situation (but still leaving hints all along). It's
really satisfying to play the conjecture game along with the narrative, and
slowly see everything come together at the end.

OK I'm not even going to try to avoid spoilers, because any real description of
this novel is going to spoil it. You have been warned.

Major wins:

- the sheer strangeness of the narrator's being
- the slow evolution they go through as the story reveals itself
- their pattering tone of voice, as they refuse to state most things as unequivocal
    fact, which makes the punctuations of direct statement all the stronger
- strong trans protagonist
- strong women
- allies taking only as much spotlight as is necessary for them to back up the
    protagonist

I... I'm finding it hard to have much to say about this book. I think the thing
that sticks with me most is its tone and framing. The plot is pretty prosaic.
Some cross between the Trojan War and Hamlet, these are honestly pretty familiar
stories by now. Sure, there's a cool dimension with the way the gods interact
with the world, but it's not that far off of Greek myth.

The way that The Patience narrates in direct address, and the fact that we never
see Eolo's own thoughts though... and the fact that we still get so much of
Eolo, is very cool. As is... how well Patience camouflages their power and
purpose until the very end. Leckie is _incredibly_ good at writing characters
that keep their own counsel despite being focal, narrators, or points of view.
The Patience is probably better than Breq. Which, fair, the Patience also has
the benefit of being in a direct address mode, rather than first or third person
mode, but still. They keep things very close to the chest.

I think... yea. The thing that will stick with me from this book is not so much
the narrative, but the form. Which is no bad thing. It's just so... alienating,
yet welcoming at the same time.

100% worth the read, and might make it into my list of most thought about books,
but not my list of favorite books (which I know, is a strange and maybe
contradictory distinction).
