summary: |
  A murder is committed in a city divided between two places, a place where it
  is a breach of some metaphysical (maybe?) laws to see from one city into the
  other, even when the border is invisible and randomly dispersed across the
  city's geography. Very cool world-building, and really considers the
  implications and knock-on effects of a city claimed by two coincident worlds.

So.. tbh I kinda bounced off of this one. I find Mieville difficult a lot of the
time, and I never really got into the intrigue here.

I did find the world fascinating, and I'm sure there are things to say about
divided places like Berlin, Jerusalem, heck, even Ireland and probably Hong
Kong. Lots to think about with duality and allegiances of place, and what that
means politically.

It'll probably percolate in the back of my head for a while, and I may come back
to this later on and finish it. For now, though, I liked what I read, but not
enough to stick it.
