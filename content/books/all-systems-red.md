summary: |

  a team of researchers on a frontier planet. When things go wrong, they have to
  balance maintaining their own identity and secrets, and trusting the
  researchers so they can all survive.

I don't want to say too much about this--it's a short, fast read, and I'm
worried I'll spoil things.

The thing that really drew me in to this is just how much I relate to
Murderbot's complete and total aversion to contact with people. Considering
they're[^murderbot-gender] a part organic, part mechanical construct that can
appear human and is fully sapient (not merely sentient), it makes a lot of sense
that they'd find interaction with people who at turns use them, pity them, or...
i don't know, weirdly fetishize them for their difference and being to be
difficult[^fetishization-marginalized-experience].

I'm not saying I have the aversion for the same reasons (I just sometimes find
social and emotional labor really difficult), but I felt very seen when reading
those passages. Wells writes social anxiety and aversion well.

More generally, this is a classic sitch where a conventional sci-fi adventure
story (scientists on hostile planet survive to win the day, with the help of
Murderbot), is actually a vehicle for the more philosophical themes. The core of
it is what is personhood and maybe sometimes we're not so even-handed when
meting that out as we think we are.

The novella plays this pretty straight--you don't have to dig far to get them.
But Wells handles them with care and nuance even in that directness, which I
really appreciate.

[^murderbot-gender]: I'm going to go with 'they' since I don't remember it being stated in the novella, but given the absence of anything other than the story... I think of Murderbot as a 'she'? Dunno. Using 'they' though.
[^fetishization-marginalized-experience]: I don't know... does this maybe sound like how we white people on the left often behave towards PoC? Or cis folk towards trans? Men towards women?
