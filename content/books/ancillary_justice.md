summary: |
  Breq, who used to be a segment in the hive-mind-esque warship Justice of
  Toren, seeks revenge against the Lord of the Radch, Anaander Miaanai, for not
  only destroying her, but also for forcing her to kill her favorite officer.
  It rings the bell of Iain M. Banks Culture series, and addresses head on
  the ghosts of colonialism and hegemony that lurk there.
personal_review: |
  This is a super good book.
