summary: |
  Having failed to kill Anaander Mianaai, Breq instead accepts a commission
  as the captain of a ship from her, and goes to a nearby system, Athoek, to help
  stabilize it as a civil war in the Radch brews. In Athoek Breq discovers that
  in addition to perpetuating massive division between 'civlized' citizens and
  more recently 'annexed' (read: colonized and conquered) citizens, that the
  more war-like and xenophobic part of Anaander Mianaai may also have deeper,
  more dangerous, and far older secrets here. Also, Breq tries to help.

Compared to the first book, _Ancillary Justice_, this one feels a lot more
classical space opera: our protagonist is now the captain of a warship, and
we're getting to meet more warships and space soldiers and seeing more space
stations... you get where I'm headed with this.

We also get to finally meet the Presger, the big bad truly alien threat-ghost
that's been haunting the Radch through the last book... in the form of their
delightfully strange 'Translator' Dlique.

Breq, despite being an admiral now and having a lot more power, spends most of
her time going straight to the bottoms of social hierarchies and really trying
to help. Which fucks off a lot of the people you'd expect--those who have been
profiting from the inequities that get hidden behind the buzzwords of _justice_,
_propriety_, and _benefit_ that the citizens of the Radch swear by. They never
want to lose their edge, or, Breq notes, bear the cost of admitting they have
been wrong and unjust, improper, and benefiting at the _expense_ of others.

Where _Justice_ hints at the difficulty of decolonization, and how much of what
is taken for granted by colonizers has to be sacrificed in the theater of her
own body, _Sword_ puts this right front and center with actual populations and
cultures.

We meet a group of _transportees_ (which is a pretty heckin' loaded term[^1])
who are routinely exploited, whose speech is ripped away from them by
assumptions about their laziness and proclivities, and who, even when they speak
eloquently, clearly, and forcefully about their situation cannot escape these
assumptions. And we meet other 'newer' Radchaai citizens, though not as new as
the transportees, who are maybe most vociferous in reinforcing these
assumptions, and who fight dearly to maintain their identities in orientation to
the transportees.

At no point does Leckie give us the idea that anyone but the Radch is ultimately
responsible for any of this... but she is _very_ good at showing how complicated
it can be to meet everyone's needs once you've fucked a situation up this badly.

More generally, I'm in love with these characters. Seivarden is still
complicated and struggles, the new character Teisarwat is a new fave... and Breq
is still one of my new heroes. She never shirks responsibility for the things
she has done or been part of, even when she could _very_ easily pin the blame
for some of them on people who could literally make her do anything, when she's
talking to someone directly and massively affected by it. And she is always
resolutely looking for ways to help those who have been most exploited, while
never stepping out of the shadow of her own privileged (well... complicated
privilege) heritage.

Basically, I want to be more like her--owning what I've gotten for free at the
expense of others, and using it to help others on their own terms.
