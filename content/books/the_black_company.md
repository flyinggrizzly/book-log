This book... I didn't like it much. I get that it's a foundational classic of
modern fantasy, but honestly, I didn't find the characters all that compelling,
and it's kinda just grim. Erikson I think has done better small-time soldiers in
a fantasy setting characters, and these people are just _bad_, and get valorized
by virtue of their position as protagonists.

Cook does try at least to demonstrate that these people are the bad guys, and
there is a particularly disgusting dream later on that the narrator has that
involves underage girls, but it feels like barely a nod to "don't forget these
are the baddies" right before the climax. The narrator at least calls direct
attention to the fact that he's disgusting in that moment. 

Plot-wise, a mercenary company gets contracted to work for the rising Evil on
the other side of the ocean, and has their current contract terminated under
questionable circumstances. Cue 200+ pages of boring warfare, and hunting down
the Rebel, and finding out that they're losing the war even though the
mercenaries are winning because they're the only competent people fighting for
the Evil.

Follow this with some stock fantasy prophecy about the White Rose coming to
overthrow the Evil, and some pretty obvious hints that she's been hiding with
the mercenaries all along so we can get a moment of "no, really, they're good
deep down because they like her and make sure she escapes to fight another day"
when really, if they were good, they could have just killed the Evil several
times over.

As much as I dislike _this book_, I really like the genre that it breaks
out--grittier fantasy that focuses on more every-day folk caught up in the
currents of politics and magic beyond their power or real understanding. I like
what Erikson does with it in _Gardens of the Moon_, and it's the foundation for
a very cool RPG, [_Band of Blades_](https://www.evilhat.com/home/band-of-blades/).
I like this a lot more than standard epic fantasy, but this book is not great.

The version I was reading was part of a collection of the first three books in
the series. I bailed 60 pages into the second, and returned it to the library.
